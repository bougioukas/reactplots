They provide dynamic ways to explore and communicate data, allowing users to interact with graphical representations, such as zooming, filtering, and adjusting parameters in real time. In recent years, the R programming language has become one of the leading environments for data analysis and visualization, primarily due to its rich ecosystem of libraries like ggplot2, plotly, shiny, leaflet, gganimate, and dygraphs."
